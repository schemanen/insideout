				<h6>Most facilities and workplace managers conduct regular workplace utilisation surveys of desk usage either using manual counting or desk sensors. Reports generated from these show granular information about the average as well as peak utilisation of desk utilisation.</h6>

				<h6>There are some easy wins to increase desk utilisation in your office.</h6>

				<h5>Floor occupancy distribution</h5>

				<h6>Looking at your desk occupancy distribution chart (figure 1), we quickly identify the specific numbers of desks that are used 0-20% of the time over a given period. These desks can easily be repurposed as flexible working desks, without risking overutilisation.<br/>
				Additionally, we identify that 10 desks are used 20-40% of the time. Allocating at least 5 of those desks to flexible desking will still give you enough desks.

				<h6>By tagging specific teams on your floor plans, you are able to view their utilisation rates and benchmark their performance.</h6>

				<h6>In figure 2 it’s clear that this team has over 50 desks which are severely underutilised. The metric ‘peak occupied’ highlights that no more than 56 desks were utilised at the same time in the specified period.
